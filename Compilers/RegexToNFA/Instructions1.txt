- The assignment is an individual assignment. 
- Don't forget you should stick to Thompsonâ€™s construction algorithm as it is
- Use any language you want, recommended Python 
- Each student should upload a ".py" file that runs as follow 
                                     python filename.py convert "[a-zA-Z]*"
for other languages you should upload an "exe" file that run as 
                                     filename.exe convert "[a-zA-Z]*"
- The file name should be ID_name.py (e.g. 12345_Abdelrahman_Kaseb.py)

Regarding programming assignments 1 and 2.
For those who finished the assignment as it is, you will take bouns grades
For those who didn't finish, you can solve this simplified problem
Assume that the regex contains only:
1- Match --> e.g. AB
2- OR --> e.g. A|B
3- Character set --> e.g.  [A-Z]
4- Repeat one or more --> A+
5- Repeat zero or more --> A*
6- Parentheses --> (AB)
7- Any combination of these rules by adding parentheses after each part 
for example, if we want to write (AB|C[A-Z])+ 
it should be written as (((AB)|C)[A-Z])+
this will simplify regex check and convert to NFA


The assignment should be delivered on Saturday (30/4), but we will allow a three-day delay without affecting the grades
